Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Steganography

Abstract:

Steganography is a technique to hide secret information in some other data (we call it a vessel) 
without leaving any apparent evidence of data alteration. 
All of the traditional steganographic techniques have limited information-hiding capacity. 
They can hide only 10% (or less) of the data amounts of the vessel. 
This is because the principle of those techniques was either to replace a special part of the frequency components of the vessel image, 
or to replace all the least significant bits of a multivalued image with the secret information. 

Our new Steganography uses an image as the vessel data, and we embed secret information in the bit-planes of the vessel.  
This technique makes use of the characteristics of the human vision system whereby a human cannot perceive 
any shape information in a very complicated binary pattern. We can replace all of the “noise-like” regions in
the bit-planes of the vessel image with secret data without deteriorating the image quality. 
 
We termed our Steganography “BPCS-Steganography,” which stands for Bit-Plane Complexity Segmentation Steganography.
